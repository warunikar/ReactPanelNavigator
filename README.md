# ReactPanelNavigator

Basic panel navigation in React-Native.

##How to run
After cloning the repo, open a terminal and run the following commands:
- cd nativeapp
- npm install
- react-native run-ios

X-code needs to be installed to run the iOS simulator. If the Metro Bundler complains, try the following:
- rm -rf node_modules && npm install
- react-native link react-native-gesture-handler
- npm start -- --reset-cache
